        <h3 style="text-align:center; text-decoration:underline;">Behind the Screen: The Damaging Effects of Algorithmic Bias on social media. </h3>
         <p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
        This study aims to investigate the connection between social media usage and the impacts it has on people's personal lives. Personal handheld devices and the widespread use of social media platforms have caused people to spend more time on their smartphones, leading to concerns about the impact of social media on emotional, mental, and physical well-being. This project aims to investigate the relationship between social media usage and its consequences on individuals' private lives using Kaggle's Social Media Influence dataset. Our research will provide insights into the implications of social media usage on individuals' personal lives and highlight the need for strategies to mitigate the potential negative impacts on mental and physical health.<p></p>
        
        <p><strong> Literature review:</strong> <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.693183/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a> </p>
       <p> Our daily lives have become increasingly reliant on social media platforms, which give us a digital forum for connection, communication, and knowledge sharing. The development of social media technologies has changed how individuals communicate with one another in both their personal and professional lives. Users can now collaborate and communicate online thanks to social media platforms like weblogs, blogs, wikis, broadcasts, photographs, and videos. In contrast to typical one-way communication in conventional media, social media has made two-way contact between users possible.
    </p>
        <p>Javed conducted a study to investigate the impact of social media on employee performance, productivity, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment. The study found that social media has a positive effect on employee performance and productivity, and it also facilitates knowledge-sharing and innovation within organizations. However, excessive use of social media can lead to potential risks to mental health and well-being, such as anxiety, depression, and other mental health problems, as well as negative impacts on physical health, such as poor sleep quality and increased sedentary behavior. Therefore, it is crucial to encourage healthy social media use and develop strategies to mitigate the potential negative impacts of social media on mental and physical health.<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563219303723?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[5]</a> </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>Research question:</strong></p>
<p>According to research, how much time people spend on social media relates to their personal life. We will specifically investigate the following issues:</p>
<ol>
  <li>How long do people typically spend on social media in a day?</li>
  <li>How is social media impacting user's mood?</li>
  <li>Which community members use social media platforms more frequently?</li>
  <li>Are people prepared to give up social media in return for faster professional advancement?</li>

        <p><strong>Methods:</strong></p>
            
<u>1.	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:</u> <a href="https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/what-is-data-cleaning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[7]</a> 
        
<p>Data cleaning and preprocessing are essential steps in preparing a dataset for analysis. In the context of the Social Media Influence dataset from Kaggle, data cleaning involves identifying and correcting inaccurate, damaged, duplicate, or incomplete data points. Conversely, preprocessing consists in transforming the data into a more usable format, such as converting categorical variables into numerical ones or scaling variables to have similar ranges.</p>
<p>Several techniques can be used to clean and preprocess the Social Media Influence dataset with the help of python libraries. The preprocessing of data achieves the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fixing structural errors.</li>
  <li>Filtering unwanted outliners.</li>
  <li>Handling missing data.</li>
  <li>Transforming dataset into quality data.</li>
</ol>

<u>Data Quality:</u>

<p>Various measures must be taken to ensure quality data in the Social Media Influence dataset. Firstly, the validity of the data needs to be checked to ensure that it measures what it intends to measure and conforms to the dataset's purpose. Accuracy should be verified to ensure that the data is error-free and precise. Completeness of the data is crucial to ensure that all values are present in the results. Consistency is also vital to ensure that the data is uniform and free of contradictions and that all the data points follow the same format. Finally, uniformity should be maintained throughout the dataset to ensure consistency across all its attributes. Ensuring these qualities are met, the Social Media Influence dataset can be considered quality data, effectively used for various analyses and applications.</p>

<p>Importance of data cleaning:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Removal of inaccuracies when several data sources are involved.</li>
  <li>Clients are happier and employees are less annoyed when there are fewer mistakes.</li>
  <li>Monitoring mistakes and improving reporting make it easier to resolve incorrect or damaged data for future applications by allowing users to identify where issues are coming from.</li>
